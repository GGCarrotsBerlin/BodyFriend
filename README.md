# BodyFriend

Description:
BodyFriend is an intimate conversation with your body. 

The idea is to access your data from:
   - medical records
   - wearables to track your fitness level, e.g FitBit, 8fit, iWatch, Jawbone etc
   - social media to know your hobbies, friends etc 
   - other apps like MyCalendar
 and connect it to reliable data sources like
   - medical article database like pubmed.org, ipool etc
   - online search engines
so that BodyFriend is your first point of contact to adress your health concerns and get reliable answers.

Future ideas, improvements:
  - use of AI to make the conversation customized
  - integrate other data sources
  - quality assurance over data
  - hadle privacy issues
